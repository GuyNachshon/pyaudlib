    "Dataset creation and (re-)organization is the starting point of almost every data-related task. This notebook covers a few popular datasets for speech recognition, enhancement, and activity detection included in `audlib.data`. All datasets follow [PyTorch's convention](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/utils/data/dataset.html#Dataset) and therefore are compatible with its [data-loader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/utils/data/dataloader.html#DataLoader) out-of-the-box (it will require each relevant dataset on disk, of course).\n",
